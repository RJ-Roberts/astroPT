# astroPT

A simple repository for training astronomical large observation models. This
repository began its life as Andrej Karpathy's
[nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), and has been altered so that it
is usable for imagery data.  Within `train.py` you will find a ~300-line
boilerplate training loop and within `model.py` you will find a ~300-line GPT
model definition with an MLP tokeniser and a regressive loss.
